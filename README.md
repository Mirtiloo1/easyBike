### Usage

1.  **Start the Local Server:**
    In the project directory, run the following command to start the Node.js server:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    You can also use the npm script if available:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Accessing via Ngrok (Optional):**
    To expose your local server to the internet for testing or demonstration, you can use ngrok.

    - First, [download and set up ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) from the official website.
    - While your local server (`node server.js`) is running, open a **new terminal window**.
    - Run the following command to create a public tunnel to your local port 3000:
    ```bash
    ngrok http 3000
    ```
    - Ngrok will display a public forwarding URL (e.g., `https://xxxx-xxxx.ngrok-free.app`). Open this URL in your browser to access your application from anywhere.
